# Clinical Genomic Testing

Since DNA can affect your health, hospitals and doctors will sometimes order DNA tests in addition to more traditional medical tests.



There are [different types of genetic tests](<https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/gtesting/genetic_testing.htm>) that might be ordered by a doctor. For example, if parents have a family history of a genetic disease like [sickle-cell anemia](<https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/facts.html>) or [Tay-Sachs disease](<https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tay-sachs-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20378190>), they might have a specific genetic test that checks whether they are likely to give that disease to their children.



Fetuses themselves are often tested as well, both for specific genes (which can cause diseases like cystic fibrosis) and for large changes in chromosomes ([^5]) that can cause diseases like Down Syndrome. 



Clinical tests can also be important for diagnosis of *susceptibility* to certain diseases. This includes testing for the BRCA1/2 genes, which can indicate how likely a patient is to develop a certain types of ovarian and breast cancers. After positve susceptibility testing, some patients may decide to take proactive measures. [^6]

Importantly, most clinical genomic testing is looks for something very specific. In contrast, newer technologies, like sequencing [the entire genome] or [all the DNA that makes proteins], can be used without any particular disease or gene in mind. While these tests can reveal [secondary findings], such as the terrifying prospect of [accidentally uncovering an incurable genetic disease], there is some promise for such exploratory tests to reveal new insights into complicated traits such as [cardiovascular health].
