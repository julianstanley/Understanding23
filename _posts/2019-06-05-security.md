# How is my genomic data kept safe?

Commercial companies share customer data, but usually on an opt-in basis. ~[80%](<https://mediacenter.23andme.com/company/about-us/>) of 23andMe customers agree to let their data be shared for research.

Other companies let people upload their genomes to find relatives. One example is [GEDmatch](<https://www.gedmatch.com/>) , which was important in resolving the [Golden State Killer](<https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/we-will-find-you-dna-search-used-nab-golden-state-killer-can-home-about-60-white>) case. 

Websites like GEDmatch are possible because DNA is very similar between relatives. So, even if your DNA has not been sequenced, you can be identified via your relatives.

Genetic data can be used to discriminate against employees.  For example, in 2002 a railroad company forced its employees to undergo a genetic test. They [faced disciplinary action](<https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/5-8-02.cfm>) but, if genomic data was public, they may have been able to discriminate without attracting as much attention. ([^9])

So, how liable is your genomic data to becoming public?

Genome testing companies and hospitals encrypt identifying information before sharing data. They then decide whether or not identifying information can be re-accessed with a password ([^10]).

But, even with encryption, genomic data can be re-identified with some effort. And, as we saw with the GEDmatch example, your distant relatives genomes can be used to identify you. 

Further, hackers don't need to reveal whole genomes. For example, when James Watson released his DNA in 2008, he chose to keep the APOE gene--which is associated with Alzheimer's disease--private. But, based on statistical models, ([^111]) it was relatively straightforward to infer his APOE genotype from his other genes.

The take-away is: whenever you submit your DNA to a company or a hospital, ask about their data privacy practices. Even if small amounts of your DNA sequence are released, it could reveal private aspects of your health and the health of your relatives to individuals and organizations that could discriminate against you on the basis of that information. 

[^9]: The U.S. has the [Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act](<https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/gina.cfm>) that bars health insurance companies for discriminating based on genetics, but does not apply to life insurance or employers.
[^10]: This is a pretty dense topic, but it's absolutely worth getting into, if you have time. [This open-access academic paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5894154/) is a great resource, if you're interested.
[^11]: These models are called **imputation**, and they're really common in research. It lets researchers use small amounts of genetic testing to reconstruct most of the genome (remember, 99.9% of our genes are identical, so it's not as monumental of a task as it may seem).
