## Wrapping Up

Why does this matter, again? Here's a quick summary of what you learned on this website:

1. Your genome is the chemical code that determines how your body develops and works on a day-to-day basis. 
2. Hospitals and doctors can determine the sequence of your genome to help determine your susceptibility to certain diseases.
3. Direct-to-consumer companies like 23andMe will also sequence your genome, but those services cannot tell you much about your health, and should be taken with a grain of salt. 
4. Whether you get your genome sequenced by a doctor or by a company, your personal data will likely be stored in an encrypted database which, if hacked, could make you at risk for data-based discrimination. It is likely wise to be aware of how your data is stored and kept safe.
