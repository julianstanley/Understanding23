# Direct to Consumer (DTC) Tests

Companies like 23andMe, Veritas, Color, and Ancestry market at-home genetic testing directly to consumers.



They work by either sequencing your whole genome or sequencing around one million base pairs in your genome (array-based sequencing).



Let's start with array-based sequencing. The average person has around 3 billion DNA bases, but only less than 1% of those bases (around 20 million) vary, on average. If you just sequence about a million DNA bases, you can learn some things about health, and a good few things about ancestry. 



Ancestry and 23andMe all use array-based sequencing to predict where your ancestors came from. Their ancestry predictions are based on their database of genetic information--so they are usually much more accurate for people of European descent.  



23andMe and Color use array-based sequencing to predict health traits. Until last year, none of these tests were FDA approved. Then, 23andMe approval for tests for a handful of genes, including the BRCA1 cancer genes. Still, their results are still not diagnostic, and should not be used to make any medical choices. ([^7]) 



Companies like Veritas offer whole-genome sequencing for health purposes, and require a doctor's order. ([^8]). Instead of just sequencing around one million genetic variants, they sequence the entire, 3-billion base-pair genome, for somewhere between $200 and $1000. Veritas argues that whole-genome sequencing can reveal health (and ancestry)  insights that array-based sequencing cannot, but the industry is still poorly regulated and cannot diagnose disease.

Overall: at this point in time, DTC genomic tests should be treated as a novelty. Their ancestry tests are not always accurate, and their health tests have limited uses, and can often cause unnecessary panic. 



[^7]: This is because, for example, BRCA1 does cause cancer, just slightly increases your chances, and having a normal BRCA1 gene does not significantly change your risk for cancer overall. Part of the reason why 23andMe has gotten FDA approval is because their educational material is fantastic (although, some argue that consumers still misinterpret genetic data, since it takes a lot of time and effort to read educational material). For example, you might want to take a look at their [BRCA info page](https://www.23andme.com/brca).
[^8]: Companies like Veritas have attracted scrutiny for having a network of doctors who are willing to order genetic tests for essentially [anyone who wants them](<https://www.statnews.com/2018/03/16/genetic-tests-fda-regulation/>).
