# Welcome to Gene Info!

This is a website about understanding your genomic data in an era of data encryption, huge healthcare data, and consumer testing companies like 23andMe.

I hope that this webpage is informational and can help you better understand how your genome data affects your life, and how it is kept safe. This short project was developed as a writing assignment
for [Northeastern University's Interdiscplinary Advanced Writing](https://www.northeastern.edu/writing/advanced-writing-in-the-disciplines/) course in Summer 2019.
