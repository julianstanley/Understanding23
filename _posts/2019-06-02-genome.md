# What is my genome?

In short: your [genome](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-a-genome) is just a collection of all of your genes. Your genes are the chemical instructions that your body uses to form, grow, and develop.



In more detail, your genome is a *chemical* that sits at the center of each of your body’s millions of cells.  Its mostly made of the compound deoxyribose nucleic acid, or DNA, which itself is made of a long string of four smaller chemicals, called DNA “bases”, which we call ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘C’, and ‘G’. ([^1],[^2]) In most cases, half of your DNA sequence comes from your father, and half from your mother.  



DNA bases are often compared to the letters in a recipe book that your cells use to make your body work. Keeping up that analogy, the recipe book is huge: if you printed all of the ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘C’, and ‘G’ letters, it would be over [500 times larger](<https://www.veritasgenetics.com/our-thinking/whole-story>) than Proust’s *a la recherche du temps perdu*, the [longest novel ever written](<http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-novel>). Your cells take the instructions from bits of DNA and use them to make proteins, which are the microscopic machines that do the day-to-day work of keeping your body up-and-running.([^3])

Also like a recipe book, cells rarely use all of the DNA that they have. Instead, different cells use different bits of DNA to do different things. For example, while muscle cells and brain cells have the exact same DNA recipe book, they use different parts of that book to serve very different functions.

 

Understanding DNA can help you understand the relationship between your genome and your health. For example, you may have heard about things like “nature” vs. “nurture”, where people might argue about how much some trait—whether that’s high blood pressure or certain personality traits—is inherited from that person’s genes and how much comes from how they were raised, what they eat, etc. Biologists will say that basically all traits come in part from genes, and in part from the environment.([^4])



[^1]: The DNA letters stand for the chemicals [A]denine, [T]hymine, [C]ytosine, and [G]uanine.
[^2]: Technically, DNA is made up of smaller chemicals called nucleotides. Nucleotides have three parts, one of which is the DNA base. Since you can tell nucleotides apart by looking at their base (A, T, C, or G), we use those letters to identify them.
[^3]: Literally! For example, some proteins have designs that look just like [modern motors](<https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2017/12/15/flagellar-motors-3/>). These structures are so astounding and complex that they have historically been used to argue [against the well-established model of evolution](<https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/129214>).  
[^4]: In fact, there are whole fields of study where traits are given actual *numbers* to describe how [much of that trait comes from genes and how much is from the environment.](<https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/estimating-trait-heritability-46889>).
