# What is my genome?

In short: your [genome](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-a-genome) is just a collection of all of your genes, the chemical instructions that your body uses to grow and live.



More specifically, your genome is a *chemical* found at the center of each of your body’s millions of cells.  Your genome is mostly made of the compound called DNA, which itself is made
of a long string of four smaller chemicals, called DNA “bases”, which we abbreviate ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘C’, and ‘G’. ([^1],[^2]) Most of your DNA is inherited—half from your biological mother and half from your biological father.



DNA is like a recipe book that your cells use to keep you alive. The genetic recipe book is huge: if you printed all of the ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘C’, and ‘G’ letters, it would be over [500 times larger](<https://www.veritasgenetics.com/our-thinking/whole-story>) than Proust’s *a la recherche du temps perdu*, the [longest novel written](<http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-novel>). Your cells use DNA recipes to make proteins, the microscopic machines that keep your body up-and-running. ([^3])

Cells never use all their DNA. Instead, they choose which DNA recipes to make. For example, while muscle and brain cells have the same DNA copy, they make different proteins to perform their different roles.

 

DNA affects your health, but it's not the only player. You may have heard about "nature v.s. nurture" in determining traits like blood pressure or personality. Most traits are affected by **both** genes and the environment. ([^4])  For example, people have different types of the gene that makes insulin, the protein that digests sugars. Because of these genetic differences, people can be more or less likely be overweight or develop diabetes. That’s a nature part. But nurture still matters: someone who eats a dozen donuts for breakfast daily will be at higher risk for diabetes, regardless of their genetics.

 
  



[^1]: The DNA letters stand for the chemicals **A**denine, **T**hymine, **C**ytosine, and **G**uanine.
[^2]: Technically, DNA is made up of smaller chemicals called nucleotides. Nucleotides have three parts, one of which is the DNA base. Since you can tell nucleotides apart by looking at their base (A, T, C, or G), we use those letters to identify them.
[^3]: Literally! For example, some proteins have designs that look just like [modern motors](<https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2017/12/15/flagellar-motors-3/>). These structures are so astounding and complex that they have historically been used to argue [against the well-established model of evolution](<https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/129214>).  
[^4]: In fact, there are whole fields of study where traits are given actual *numbers* to describe how [much of that trait comes from genes and how much is from the environment.](<https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/estimating-trait-heritability-46889>).
